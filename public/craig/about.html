              <h2><a href="#">My Practice Philosophy</a></h2>
              <p>
                I believe in providing my patients with the best
                possible foot care. I am well-trained in traditional
                foot surgery, modern minimal-incision surgery, and the
                lastest technologically-advanced LASER surgery.
              </p>  
              <p>
                Podiatry has come a long way from trimming corns and
                filing nails. The underlying causes of corns, callouses,
                and ingrown nails are now understood and treatable.
                Rather than repeated trimming and filing, I advocate
                treating the underlying cause of the problem. I outline
                the surgical options: traditional, minimal-incision, or
                LASER therapy. Then taking into account each individual
                patient's needs and desires, we
                decide <strong>together</strong> on a specific treatment
                plan. I strive to educate each patient about his/her
                particular foot problem, so he/she can fully participate
                in chooding a treatment plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most procedures are done in the comfortable setting of
                my office. Usually my patients can walk immediately
                after the procedure. The healing time is usually very
                brief. I see my post-surgical patients frequently to
                keep a close eye on the healing process to make keep
                on the right path for a full recovery. Because I am
                very concerned about my patient's comfort, I usually
                prescribe a few pain pills for the evening after
                surgery. Many patients tell me they did not nee to
                take a single pill because the discomfort was so
                minimal, but I would rather keep it on the safe side
                and allow my patients to enjoy the most comfort
                possible after surgery.
              </p>
              <p>
                I welcome questions from all of my patients, and I am
                always happy to discuss each individual foot problem.
                I want to work with you to resolve your foot needs.
                Please don't hesitate to call me.
              </p>

            <div class="boxtxt">
              <p>
                Since graduation from podiatry school, I have helped
                more than 50,000 patients with foot problems. I have
                take care of thousands of warts, ingrown nails,
                bunions, and hammertoes. I am very experienced in
                LASER therapy of soft tissue problems: fungal nails,
                ingrown nails, neuromas, scars, and warts. I own a
                Hi-Tech-Laser and have taught other doctors and
                podiatrists the technique of LASER surgery.
